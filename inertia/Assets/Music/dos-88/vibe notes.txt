Billy's Sacrifice - Slow, meh.
Checking Manifest - Rythmic, Quiet, Slow. Would be good main menu music.
Crash landing - Faster. Possibly a good platforming song.
Automatav2 - I like the beat to this one. Synth comes in "woo wooo wooo" and I don't love that. Candidate.
City Stomper - another possible level song. I like the sweeping synth. Good track for lots of wall running maybe.
Far Away - sounds kinda fantasy. good hopeful song to play at a emotional sweetness.
Parabola - Takes a good 30 seconds to get going. Feels like running.
Race To Mars - probably the best song. this has a great opening, is a good "fuck yeah" song.
Smooth Sailing - Might be good for an early level. Forgettable.
