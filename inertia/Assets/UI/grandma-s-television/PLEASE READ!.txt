FOR ANY USAGE
Either: Donate money to Andrew McCluskey via PayPal: nal@nalgames.com. I recommend the donation sum is what you feel the font is worth to you and what you feel is right for what you're getting from the font - I make less from doing this than you might think!

FOR PERSONAL OR NON-PROFIT USAGE
Either: Do any of the options from "For Any Usage"

This grants you, or the organisation/etc you represent, the ability to use this font infinitely for non-commercial/non-profit (option 2) or anything whatsoever (option 1). I do not restrict what you want to use it for, anything goes.

You may redistribute this font, but please let me know via nal@nalgames.com (I won't prohibit redistribution under any circumstance) and please include everything contained within the .zip folder the font was downloaded in.

For any queries, just email nal@nalgames.com with what you want to ask, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. If you can, please include the name of the font as well as the word "font" in the email title so I can prioritise a reply to it. Cheers.
